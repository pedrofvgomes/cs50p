# CS50 Introduction to Python

Welcome to my CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python repository! This repository tracks my progress and solutions for the Harvard University CS50 course on Python programming. The course consists of nine problem sets and a final project, each designed to challenge and expand my understanding of Python.

## Problem Sets

0. **Problem Set 0 - Functions, Variables**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week0)
1. **Problem Set 1 - Conditionals**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week1)
2. **Problem Set 2 - Loops**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week2)
3. **Problem Set 3 - Exceptions**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week3)
4. **Problem Set 4 - Libraries**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week4)
5. **Problem Set 5 - Unit Tests**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week5)
6. **Problem Set 6 - File I/O**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week6)
7. **Problem Set 7 - Regular Expressions**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week7)
8. **Problem Set 7 - Object-Oriented Programming**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week8)
9. **Problem Set 9 - Et Cetera / Final Project**: (https://github.com/pedrofvgomes/cs50p/tree/main/week0) 
The culmination of the course where I designed and implemented my own Python project.

## Final Project

The final project is the highlight of this course. I created [insert project name here], a [brief project description here]. You can find the project's source code and documentation in the dedicated [Final Project repository](link-to-final-project-repo).
